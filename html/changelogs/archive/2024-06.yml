      more intuitive and efficient.

  Absolucy:
  - rscadd: Engineers now have an RCD round start.
  - balance: RCD construction/deconstruction effects can now be attacked in order
      to cancel them. You can get the anti-disruption upgrade disk to prevent this.

      effect up. This does not effect reconstruction.

      any other RCDs such as combat RCDs.
  - rscadd: RCDs can make girders now.
